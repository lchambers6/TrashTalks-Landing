						TrashTalks has a mission to change the way that people think about their waste. 
						Through data analytics, consulting services, and innovative technology we educate 
						people and businesses to create a world where trash is no longer viewed as a waste, 
						but instead a resource. We believe that a circular economy is possible and we want 
						to do our part in creating it. TrashTalks is honored to begin as part of the Georgia 
						Tech CREATE-X accelerator where we are excited to grow and blossom.
						<br/><br/>
						The TrashTalks mobile application is coming soon! Please email trashtalks2018@gmail.com to request more information.
